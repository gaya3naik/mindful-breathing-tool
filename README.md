# üßò Mindful Breathing Timer - A Moment of Calm

This is a small web application I built to serve a simple but important purpose: to make it easy for anyone to take a few minutes to practice mindful breathing. It uses the "box breathing" technique to help calm the nervous system and anchor you in the present moment.

## üåü My Favorite Features

I had a lot of fun building this, and a few features stand out:

*   **The Organic Animation:** Instead of a rigid square, the box gently morphs into a circle as you inhale. It feels more natural and soothing.
*   **Dynamic Theming:** The breathing circle gets a new, random pastel gradient every time you start a new session, which always feels like a fresh start.
*   **Self-Contained & Portable:** The entire application‚Äîstyles, scripts, and even the audio cues‚Äîis packed into a single `index.html` file. This means it's incredibly fast, requires no build steps, and can be hosted anywhere.

## üìã Full Feature List

- **Guided Box Breathing:** Visual and audio cues for the 4-4-4-4 breathing pattern.
- **Custom Session Length:** You can set a timer for your desired practice duration.
- **Soothing Interface:** A full-screen gradient background and clean design to minimize distractions.
- **Audio Cues:** Gentle sounds for inhaling and exhaling.
- **Mindful Affirmations:** A rewarding quote appears after each completed session.
- **Fully Responsive:** Works beautifully on both desktop and mobile browsers.
